## Requirements

- norns
- crow (optional)

## Documentation

- K2/K3 changes sector
- E2/E3 modifies sector position
- K1+EX modifies parameters

each line represents a note on the spectrum. the spectrum is divided into 4 "sectors". the sectors emit notes based on their space along the spectrum (which is changed with E2/E3). each sector has parameters that can be modified with K1+E1/2/3, and more in the parameters menu.

if you are using crow, you can assign crow to specific sectors for [emitting pitches directly](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ch4daaDAdkG/) from spectrum emissions.
